## Features

- Scrolls through interactive content like "likes" or saved items.
- Simulates unliking or removing interactions through DOM manipulation.
- Includes randomized delays to mimic human behavior.
- 100% browser-based – no third-party apps, logins, or API keys required.

## How It Works

The script runs in your browser’s Developer Console.  
It interacts with the webpage’s DOM — just like a human would — by:

- Scrolling through content
- Detecting interactive elements (such as "like" buttons)
- Clicking them with a delay

This tool is meant to demonstrate safe browser-side scripting only.

---

## Usage (Test Environment Only)

1. Open your browser and navigate to the relevant activity/interactions page.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to open Developer Tools.
3. Go to the Console tab.
4. Paste the script from `feed-cleanup.js` and press Enter.

The script will begin automating the interaction cleanup process. Never run it on a site you do not own.
