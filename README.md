## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Demonstrates DOM manipulation and event simulation using plain JavaScript
- Shows how to scroll, detect elements, and simulate clicks

## üß™ How It Works (Test Environment Only)

This script runs inside your browser‚Äôs Developer Console, and:

1. Scrolls through a webpage
2. Detects targetable interactive elements (e.g., buttons or links)
3. Simulates delayed click interactions for automation learning

‚ö†Ô∏è Again, **only use this on test pages or mock HTML sites** you have full control over.
